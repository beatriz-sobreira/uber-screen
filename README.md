In class we had an overview of the project and tried to reproduce it, then the professor of front-end development did his own version of it.
At home I did all again, but considering the corrections on my version, and did an upgrade using opacity and transition on the buttons.

At first I had some help from my colleagues, but at home, in my own time, I was able to understand better what was happening on both HTML and CSS.
